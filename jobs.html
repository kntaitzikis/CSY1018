                <h2>Front-End Web Development Jobs</h2>
                <p class="p-text">
                    Also referred to as client-side, the front-end is coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                    and includes all design and functionality elements such as drop-down menus, buttons, scrolling, etc.
                </p>
                <h3>Front-End Developer</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    Front-end developers are responsible for bringing websites and products to life on your screen.
                    These web developers write the code that gets executed in the browser rather than in the server.
                    This means that front-end devs need to know about the browsers they need to support, which includes mobile browsers.
                    In addition to engineering the code that will deploy the design plans, front-end developers must consider accessibility,
                    SEO, performance, load times, and analytics. Front-end web developers should have a strong grasp on HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript, and it’s useful for them to be versed in testing, as well. 
                </p>
                <h3>Web Designer</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    A web designer, as you may have deduced, designs websites. This job function also includes responsive/ mobile design
                    and design of mobile apps. Web designs determine what features and aesthetic a web page/ app needs in order to be both easy
                    and enjoyable to use. Most web designers will be proficient in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript,
                    but whether the designer interacts directly with the browser often depends on the size of the team.
                    UX and visual designers also fall under the umbrella of web designers, though they focus on different aspects of design.
                </p>
                <h3>UX Designer</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    The sole focus of the user experience (UX) designer is to create experiences that will keep website and product users
                    coming back for more. These designers derive inspiration from the their users by studying their behaviors and interactions
                    with digital products, performing research, and testing to inform, refine, and validate design choices. Some UX designers
                    may implement these designs, while UX designers on larger teams will usher improvements through the system to strengthen
                    user experience with each iteration.
                </p>
                <h3>UI Designer</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    While the UX designer is focused on ease of functionality, user interface (UI) designers are focused on website aesthetics.
                    This job is more about designing and less about implementation. Thus, UI designers typically have a good understanding
                    of color theory and typography. They are skilled in working with design tools with perhaps only light skill sets HTML and CSS.

                <h2>Back-End Web Development Jobs</h2>  
                <p class="p-text">
                    The back-end, or server-side, makes up all of the behind-the-scenes workings of the site.
                    This refers to everything that the user can’t see in the browser, such as servers, applications, and databases.
                </p>
                <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    Web developers are the architects of the back-end. Web devs work with languages like Ruby, Python, PHP, and Java.
                    Unlike front-end developers, web developers don’t work closely with designers, spending more time on deeper programming
                    concepts such as security and structure.
                </p>
                <h3>QA Developer</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    Quality assurance (QA) teams will work closely with product/project managers, helping to manage the technical requirements
                    for a product. QA developers write test suites that run against the code of the products or sites that their team
                    is developing. These tests verify that all the requirements are met, and are your website’s line of defense against bugs
                    and breaking—targeting certain lines or elements of the code to ensure that the test outcomes align with the web developers’
                    expectations. Non-technical, functional testers may also be part of the QA team to test early versions of products
                    in the way that they’d expect end users to use them, and to identify problems before they make it to the user’s hands.
                </p>
                <h3>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    A full-stack developer builds on both the front and back-ends.
                </p>
                <h3>Product Manager</h3>
                <p class="p-text">
                    Product managers guide the design and development of a product or site from a big picture perspective,
                    dealing with coordinating people and plans over the individual design choices or technical aspects of the project.
